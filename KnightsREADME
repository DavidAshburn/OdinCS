When we initialize the Travails object, it accepts a starting node and populates a tree with all possible, 
valid move-orders starting there. Squares may only be visited once, we generate Nodes in level order so that we will
always find the shortest path without really looking for it. We stop processing our queue when the @board array shows all 
squares have been visited.

We initialize nodes with a routes array, as we create valid children for a node, we add the parent node to it's own
route list and pin that to every child. The @root is the only node with an empty route list since we started there.

When we want to find the shortest route, we just find the node that matches that coordinate and the shortest route is already stored.
